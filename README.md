**Features:**

1. List Data Structure: Snake body movement and management with a dynamic array list.

2. Food: Generates food and special food(s) randomly on the game. Special food(s) can boost score and/or alter snake length.

3. UI: Asynchronous console screen UI (MacUILib file), providing real time updates using user input.
   
4. Dynamic Memory Management: Allocating and deallocating memory on the heap appropriately.
   
5. Object Oriented Design: Well-organized and modular codebase, ensuring easy maintenance and future expansions.

**Usage:**

- Run the Project.exe file (command line application).
- Game Controls: 
  - WASD for movement.
  - SPACE to exit.
- Game Rules:
  - Can go around the border.
  - Game ends when the snake touches itself or reaches the max length.

The Snake Game project serves as a foundation for future enhancements and customizations, demonstrating the implementation of OOD principles in C++ programming. Users can explore the codebase to understand how different classes collaborate to create a functional and extensible snake game.
